This is a unique event that brings together therapists, teachers, and practitioners from all over the world, offering an excellent opportunity for learning, exchanging experiences, and growing together. The goal of the Congress is to create a space where participants can deepen their knowledge and skills under the guidance of international experts. Through lectures, workshops, and discussion panels, every participant will gain new tools for their practice and broaden their experience in Chinese medicine. Kraków, with its picturesque streets, the atmosphere of Kazimierz, and beautiful walks along the Vistula River, creates a perfect backdrop for this event. This year, once again, you are invited to an integration evening – a banquet that will allow for the free exchange of experiences in a friendly and relaxed atmosphere. We are eagerly awaiting the meeting with outstanding TCM teachers who will come to Kraków especially to share their knowledge and answer your questions. With joy and open hearts, we await participants – therapists, students, and all those interested in developing and deepening their TCM knowledge. It will be an unforgettable event! See you in Kraków!",
